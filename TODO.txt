the summary printout must be clarified, it is very unclean what is it printed
 out

for example:

 For 26177 total inserts
And 72823 dropped packets

what does that mean? how deoes the numbers evaluate performance?

what is the purpose of Round_trips_mope? what does that mean?

why dope simulation so much more slower?



please remove all print out statements, working with large data sets is very
disturbing then

all the logging should be controller from the runner module, where we can set
 ouput to console or just file

 also separate the debug to info, error, debug, warning etc to have a clean data
 for example we can use critical level to ouly collet data for plotting
 rather than see all the print outs
